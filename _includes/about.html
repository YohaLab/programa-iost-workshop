                        The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly developing area of communication. The IoT involves the
                        internetworking of physical devices embedded with electronics, software, and sensors that exchange data.

                        The IoT connects devices through the Internet, enabling remote monitoring and control through
                        cloudbased control systems. The IoT is becoming increasingly suitable in indoor areas and metropolitan areas
                        due to the availability of cellphone networks, Wi-Fi, and other short- and mid-range technologies that
                        facilitate communication.

                        However, there is a significant potential demand for communication outside cities where coverage is less abundant.
                        Tracking during transportation, critical infrastructure monitoring, critical environmental monitoring, and 
                        precision agriculture are potential areas that could benefit from coverage outside of cities. These areas require
                        communication over large distances but at low power to maintain the embedding capacity and reduce costs. 
                        Space-based solutions may be the only viable option for serving these areas.

                        In this context, the workshop “Building Bridges for a Global Network” will be the <b>first workshop 
                        focused on the potential coordination of the multinational Internet of Space Things (IoST) network, 
                        exploring the potentials of LPWA such as the LoRa radio technique and standardized satellites, or CubeSats</b>.

                        The 2-day workshop aims to connect the needs with the current capabilities and research on the topic. 
                        In the event, participants not only will discuss current research and projects on IoT, but also the 
                        invitation is to embrace collaboration among different kind of actors and stakeholders who may benefit 
                        from IoST's connectivity capabilities. Thus, the event expects to serve as an avenue to connect the needs 
                        with potential solutions, with a special emphasis on developing a collaborative capacity-building strategy.
